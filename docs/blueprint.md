# **App Name**: Hogwarts House Sorter

## Core Features:

- Themed Interface: Display a visually appealing interface that mimics the Sorting Hat ceremony, using a parchment-like background and themed design.
- Dynamic Question Generation: Generate a series of personality questions. The LLM will act as a "tool" using its reasoning capabilities, selecting which questions to pose from a broad dataset, aiming to distill the essence of each Hogwarts house.
- House Assignment Logic: Analyze the user's answers to the questions using AI to determine the most suitable Hogwarts house based on traits associated with each house. The AI model considers courage (Gryffindor), ambition (Slytherin), intellect (Ravenclaw), and loyalty (Hufflepuff).
- Thematic Announcement: Display a dramatic and thematic announcement of the house the user is sorted into, complete with house colors, crest, and a short description of the house's values.
- Shareable Results: Implement a feature allowing users to share their sorted house and experience on social media platforms.
